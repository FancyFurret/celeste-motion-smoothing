# Celeste Motion Smoothing

[![GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/embeddables/514173?type=sd_image)](https://gamebanana.com/mods/514173)

A mod for Celeste that raises the FPS above 60, *without* breaking physics. Settings are available to toggle the mod,
change the target framerate, and change the player smoothing mode. This essentially works by keeping the physics update
at a fixed 60 FPS, and smoothing entity/camera/etc positions during render at 120+ FPS. Should work with most modded
maps, I've been using it successfully with Strawberry Jam levels.
